You can look up the term *“Skinner Box”* if you’re curious to hear more about that.\n\nThe carrot-on-a-stick that serves as the “reinforcement” in this case can take many forms, and it is especially easy to implement in video games, because of the direct feedback in response to input, and its reliance on quantified rewards (points, achievements, etc.) Most game designers didn’t study Skinner, at least in the early days, they just stumbled upon these patterns again by accident.","user":"U5KK1P1CN","ts":"1546541842.011600","edited":{"user":"U5KK1P1CN","ts":"1546544875.000000"}},"1546539251.004800 U0992K37U":{"client_msg_id":"32f0d219-7599-470e-9696-4d4b52251405","type":"message","text":"<http://southpark.wikia.com/wiki/Freemium_Isn%27t_Free>","user":"U0992K37U","ts":"1546539251.004800","attachments":[{"service_name":"South Park Archives","title":"Freemium Isn't Free | South Park Archives | FANDOM powered by Wikia","title_link":"http://southpark.wikia.com/wiki/Freemium_Isn%27t_Free","text":"Trivia Images","fallback":"South Park Archives: Freemium Isn't Free | South Park Archives | FANDOM powered by Wikia","thumb_url":"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/southpark/images/4/4d/FreemiumIsntFreePromo2.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20141103101601","from_url":"http://southpark.wikia.com/wiki/Freemium_Isn%27t_Free","thumb_width":960,"thumb_height":540,"service_icon":"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/southpark/images/b/bc/Wiki.png/revision/latest?cb=20090107180006","id":1,"original_url":"http://southpark.wikia.com/wiki/Freemium_Isn%27t_Free"}]},"1546539218.004600 U0992K37U":{"client_msg_id":"5b792090-ddcc-4305-a738-ae31494c99f0","type":"message","text":"I always go to the South Park episode, but that doesn't trace the history.
