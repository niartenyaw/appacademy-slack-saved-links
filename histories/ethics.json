Dash’s argument caught my eye. But then, a lot of Dash’s arguments catch my eye. He’s one of the most perceptive interpreters and critics of the tech industry around these days. That’s in part because Dash is part of the world he’s describing: He’s the CEO of Glitch, the host of the excellent tech podcast Function, and a longtime developer and blogger. In this conversation, Dash and I discuss his excellent list of the 12 things everyone should know about technology. This episode left me with an idea I didn’t have going in: What if the problem with a lot of the social technologies we use — and, lately, lament — isn’t the ethics of their creators or the revenue models they’re built on, but the sheer scale they’ve achieved? What if products like Facebook and Twitter and Google have just gotten too big and too powerful for anyone to truly understand, much less manage? You know the topics that obsess me on this podcast. Polarization. Identity. Attention. I’ve come to believe that all of them are downstream from the technologies on which they rest. If you feel like society has gone a bit wrong, it’s likely because the internet has gone a bit wrong. And Dash’s arguments help explain why.

It is the inherent power of automation to displace human labor and the inevitable (given the current global market capitalist culture in charge) race to the bottom that will actualize that power. If anything, UBI is just the indulgence purchased to ease the Uber employees' conscience for their sins of disruption. Note the way it was brought up. \"Yes, we know we're doing all these terrible things. But what about UBI? Won't that make everything okay? Won't that save the lives we're otherwise destroying?\"\n\nThe takeaway is not to be against UBI. It's to remember that we mustn't give ourselves a moral pass and assume that someday there will be a political solution to clean up the mess we're creating now with our greed. Tech workers are starting to wake up to our power and what we can do to change the way our companies operate. Hopefully this will be enough.\n\nBut again, this doesn't mean forget about UBI. I think it is one of the most important policy ideas of our time. The time to implement it has not yet come, but it's on the horizon, and I think our most important task in the present is to try and prepare the political climate so that it can be implemented fairly and intelligently when the moment finally arrives and it becomes economically and socially viable.","user":"U0992K37U","ts":"1548141541.048700","thread_ts":"1548141541.048700","reply_count":19,"reply_users_count":4,"latest_reply":"1548218626.063500","reply_users":["U5KK1P1CN","U3GP0PYAF","U4PLFM85R","U0992K37U"],"replies":[{"user":"U5KK1P1CN","ts":"1548176096.055900"},{"user":"U5KK1P1CN","ts":"1548176209.057600"},{"user":"U3GP0PYAF","ts":"1548188392.058900"},{"user":"U4PLFM85R","ts":"1548190138.060000"},{"user":"U0992K37U","ts":"1548194713.060200"},{"user":"U4PLFM85R","ts":"1548198348.060500"},{"user":"U0992K37U","ts":"1548201930.060700"},{"user":"U0992K37U","ts":"1548202600.061000"},{"user":"U0992K37U","ts":"1548210588.061200"},{"user":"U0992K37U","ts":"1548210666.061400"},{"user":"U0992K37U","ts":"1548210966.061600"},{"user":"U0992K37U","ts":"1548211073.061900"},{"user":"U4PLFM85R","ts":"1548213141.062100"},{"user":"U4PLFM85R","ts":"1548213333.062300"},{"user":"U4PLFM85R","ts":"1548213722.062500"},{"user":"U0992K37U","ts":"1548216792.062900"},{"user":"U0992K37U","ts":"1548217165.063100"},{"user":"U0992K37U","ts":"1548218544.063300"},{"user":"U0992K37U","ts":"1548218626.063500"}],"subscribed":true,"last_read":"1548221129.000000"},"1548218626.063500 U0992K37U":{"client_msg_id":"8e604741-3799-4bda-80a3-f2ebb82ce658","type":"message","text":"Make no mistake, we actually all have a tremendous amount of social power, but it is mostly limited to small social groups and local communities.

We have wiped out diseases and transformed habitats, moved mountains, harnessed the power of electrons and atoms and delved the secrets of stars, as well as driven species to extinction and yes, critically altered the very air itself. All of this power is at our disposal. Even common individuals have a level of mastery over nature that the ancients could only have attributed to the gods.\n\nBut as soon as we face each other, the stakes change. We have a kind of democratic government that empowers the people, but by the time that power actually gets down to us, we get such a small sliver that we conclude our vote doesn't count. Even powerful executives and government officials feel trapped in systems of which they are only a small part. Meanwhile, the information age has made it so that only an insignificant minority of voices get amplified across the whole society, but even those voices are quickly forgotten amidst the continual stream of salient stimuli.\n\nWhat we ultimately want is social power. In the continual arms-race to achieve it, we have gained unprecedented power in the absolute sense, but paradoxically, this has decreased everyone's social power because a larger pie means more people, and more people means a smaller relative slice for each one.","user":"U0992K37U","ts":"1548218544.063300","thread_ts":"1548141541.048700","parent_user_id":"U0992K37U"},"1548217165.063100 U0992K37U":{"client_msg_id":"5a95e84c-6746-49b7-85a1-0f0b924703dd","type":"message","text":"It isn't wealth that's zero-sum, it's status, and it's social power.

This, I would argue, is the very core of greed.\n\nThe upside of this is that greed fuels economic growth. The downside is that greed fuels social collapse.

My understanding is that this was intended to be a subversion, using the meme to point out how stupid it is to use said meme. Parody. Satire.

abstract storage, facial recognition, emotions, etc) to help it guess at very complex challenges (hunting &amp; gathering, identifying kin, managing social relations, etc). because these challenges can widely vary in different locations and societies, we should expect to see those tools put to use in a variety ways (as you pointed out).\n\nthese combinations of parts to create tools can also importantly be built on each other to create more complex tools. if we think about this stack of tools, ones closer to the brain’s parts are more hardcoded and harder for the environment to influence. as more tools are added, there are more opportunities for tools through combination as well as abstraction from the actual parts. these tools can be more or completely influenced by learning, the environment, etc. so we should expect to find some traits that persist across all human populations (earlier combinations that are largely determined by genetic-based connections) and some that are completely different (later combinations of complex tools).\n\nfor instance, the combination of individual-based storage and 3d modeling allows for recognizing individuals by sight. now that we have individual recognition, we can devise a mental social hierarchy tool on top of it by storing abstract info about individual tendencies based on observations of others and our own interactions around food, mating, etc. those at the top are obviously rewarded (historically), so it makes sense to try to be there. there are many ways to go about trying to achieve that and even more tools can be built on top of those, but this can be an explanation of why we have a desire to be superior to others. which i think seems pretty reasonable to occur in a competing population of entities with the ability to identify individuals and store information about them. historically, this ability certainly meant a greater chance of survival.\n\nthere are studies that show people across different areas and cultures all show the trait of being happier when they perceive themselves to be relatively better off than those around them. information like this leads me to believe it occurs lower in this tool stack than other tools, therefore closer to the brain parts, more likely to influence the evolution of those parts through environmental pressure, and more likely to occur in populations.\n\nall of that being said, evolution is still nothing but a short-sighted optimization of imperfect gene replication and we are not solely our genes. our genes have their own goals in mind for us, but our consciousness gives us the ability to glimpse past those evolutionary tendencies that might not make sense in the current globalized world.\n\nour brains are abstractly just massive filtering and compression functions that were optimized for hunting and gathering in small bands. that type of tool obviously has to introduce bias to get a reasonable answer. that doesn’t mean we’re doomed to being biased. i think it means that it makes us, conscious self-determinant individuals, responsible for identifying and correcting those biases as best we can through systems like philosophy, logic, morality, and the scientific method. with our ability to actively influence the world around us, `because that's the way it is` should never be an acceptable answer and that’s the only type of answer evolution will ever provide.","user":"U4PLFM85R","ts":"1555459172.170300","reactions":[{"name":"+1","users":["U0992K37U","U7CFUN3SB","U5KK1P1CN"],"count":3}]},"1555440922.110900 UAR7LG9R6":{"user":"UAR7LG9R6","type":"message","subtype":"channel_join","ts":"1555440922.110900","text":"<@UAR7LG9R6> has joined the channel"},"1555440913.110700 UBLLL803G":{"user":"UBLLL803G","type":"message","subtype":"channel_join","ts":"1555440913.110700","text":"<@UBLLL803G> has joined the channel"},"1555605748.331700 U5KKJVC1L":{"client_msg_id":"e4fd451c-8c13-4ef0-ab5b-cef9f162d929","type":"message","text":"wish I had a source, but this was all from memory, very likely Jared Diamond’s _Why is Sex Fun?_ but that might be because that’s the only vaguely academic sex book I think of, could have just come up in an anthropology or some other class","user":"U5KKJVC1L","ts":"1555605748.331700","thread_ts":"1555553702.328900","parent_user_id":"U5KK1P1CN"},"1555605670.331500 U5KKJVC1L":{"client_msg_id":"32e29bdb-04ce-4038-95e9-c1ae0c2558f8","type":"message","text":"One nit worth with picking (but hiding in the comments to avoid taking away from a pretty good post)\n&gt;Actually, in quite a few hunter-gatherer societies, the connection between sex and reproduction isn’t made, culturally.

I was more proposing that a desire for superiority mostly exists in societies where inferiority is the default. This applies more to our modern society than to anything in the past, imo, where, as Jon said, a lot of hunter gathered societies were pretty egalitarian (though I admit the in-group out-group stuff complicates that dynamic quite a bit. Not confident enough to take a clear position on that just yet :thinking_face:)\n\nIt's important to remember too (well actually I noticed you said this already, <@U4PLFM85R>, now that I look again, haha) but all evolution cares about is that reproduction _happens_, and with enough variation that the species continues. Not so much that people are consciously choosing to compete for mates (LGBT people don't fit with this selfish model of reasoning, for example). Actually, in quite a few hunter-gatherer societies, the connection between sex and reproduction isn't made, culturally. Pregnancy is attributed to \"spirits\" and the like. \n\nWith that in mind, strategies that promote the survival of the group, with enough reproduction to ensure continued survival. \n\nThe length of a woman's birth cycle is also a key component of how this could work, I think. With that in mind, women could still be relatively promiscuous, and you could say that would even be _advantageous_, because it becomes ambiguous which child \"spawned from\" which man, and thus the best strategy is to protect _all_ children. Evolution loves having as much variation and diversity as possible, so I'm inclined to think that keeping as wide a variety of children alive as a tribe can is actually the best strategy. The time a woman must dedicate wouldn't change in either case, but in the second one she might have more men invested in her offspring, even if she has only one or two. A little competitive infighting between males might be a worthwhile trade off in that case. \n\nThis however, illustrates a point as to why I personally (sorry :sweat_smile:) am not a fan of Pinker's approach to reasoning about evolutionary psychology. While fascinating to think about, there is actually a lot of ambiguity there as to what is the \"dominant\" strategy (and it really tends to change over time anyway) and you can really make a case for many different approaches. \n\nThere's also a tendency to reason backwards from what is true now, when the world may have been very different back then. For example, in retrospect, farming made perfect sense, as an evolutionary strategy, because we now know that farming societies gave rise to density, specialization, invention, and thus, modern civilization (it also allowed humans to reproduce more, since they weren't moving around as much). For a hunter gatherer, however, farming was grueling work with a huge delay on return (do I grow this wheat for months, or do I hunt a mammoth/gather shellfish now?), so it was functionally mostly a backup or a last resort. This is part of why people took so long to shift to a sedentary, agricultural lifestyle (190,000 of the 200,000 years we've been around, roughly.) \n\nAll of which is just to say that humans have not always historically pursued what made them reproduce the most (have too many offspring and you might not be able to take care of any of them adequately!) Rather, they pursued what would allow reproduction with the most success, least risk, and most immediate rewards (which includes investment after birth to ensure the child survived and became a valuable member of the tribe. Infant mortality was much higher back then, after all)\n\nSo that's why I personally think promiscuity between genders is a cultural, rather than evolutionary, construct, and subscribes to the rules of variation between individuals, rather than groups.","user":"U5KK1P1CN","ts":"1555553702.328900","edited":{"user":"U5KK1P1CN","ts":"1555553902.000000"},"thread_ts":"1555553702.328900","reply_count":4,"reply_users_count":2,"latest_reply":"1555630200.369700","reply_users":["U5KKJVC1L","U5KK1P1CN"],"replies":[{"user":"U5KKJVC1L","ts":"1555605670.331500"},{"user":"U5KKJVC1L","ts":"1555605748.331700"},{"user":"U5KK1P1CN","ts":"1555629983.369500"},{"user":"U5KK1P1CN","ts":"1555630200.369700"}],"subscribed":true,"last_read":"1555630200.369700"},"1555550190.285900 U4PLFM85R":{"client_msg_id":"4278e39f-ba3c-421e-bb0a-cf51fda96af8","type":"message","text":"thanks <@U0992K37U>!\n\nahh for sure, it can be a bit more nuanced than just % genes shared. i used siblings because that comparison works, but relationships across generations are a bit different. an evolutionary entity is only successful if its offspring can be successful (and its offspring and so on). so in evolution, the most important things are survival to procreation, finding the best mate possible, and then ensuring survival of those offspring (especially when massive resources are used on that offspring, as opposed to starting over). the offspring are the chance to continue the genes and if they die, then they have wasted a lot of resources. the relationship is not bidirectional though as children should not see their parents as favorably since they are likely past their prime and the best thing they can do for _their_ genes is use any resources available for themselves. and again, this is what are genes want us to do and we should see variations based on circumstance.\n\nas for extending life, evolution can only select for genes in individuals before they procreate. any selection that happens after that doesn't affect the genes in the next generation, unless they procreate more. it's been hypothesized by people like Richard Dawkins that if we all waited until, say, 40 to procreate, we could dramatically extend the lifetime of future generations.\n\nand i totally agree, i think it's pretty clear just from observations that people can both desire dominance and have that desire influenced (if by no one else, certainly themselves).\n\ni really admire that cause. oxytocin seems like a pretty viable candidate from what you've mentioned about it. does there necessarily _have_ to be an out-group that goes along with it?

They only have 50% genetic similarity. Sure, they need to have children because they'll get old and die, but in that case, why would their body age so that they die to begin with? Wouldn't it make most sense to either never die or just create exact clones of themself, carrying on 100% of their genes as long as possible? But long-lived organisms are extremely rare and clonal reproduction is also rare outside the realm of the microscopic. It's important to remember that selection pressures work on populations as much as individuals and on lineages as much as single generations.\n\nWhatever the case, I don't want to get lost in the weeds here. The crux of the question for me is about whether or not humans have desires for dominance and whether those desires can be influenced. I think it's safe to say that both are true.\n\nDominance hierarchies exist in a large variety of species, so they probably go waaay back for us before primates or even mammals. These dynamics do look very different in different species, and it's encouraging to note that humans seem to have a mostly egalitarian social hierarchy when observed \"in the wild\", though there is of course a lot of variance due to culture, and bands with broad equality _within_ genders can still have a great disparity _between_ genders. There's also a lot to be said when it comes to the question of equality between different groups. It seems we have many fewer psychological resources to draw on here. For example, the pro-social bonding chemical oxytocin seems to actually make people _more_ hostile toward out-group members.\n\nA lot of what interests me is how we can encourage people to behave more charitably toward others, be they neighbors, strangers, or even enemies. What psychological levers are there and how can we use technology to move them? If we can use social media to dramatically increase rates of narcissism and depression, maybe we can also design systems that actually make it easier to live with each other instead of harder.","user":"U0992K37U","ts":"1555540850.246200","reactions":[{"name":"+1","users":["U7CFUN3SB","U5KK1P1CN","U4PLFM85R"],"count":3},{"name":"100","users":["U5KK1P1CN"],"count":1},{"name":"fire","users":["U5KK1P1CN"],"count":1},{"name":"clapping","users":["U5KK1P1CN"],"count":1}]},"1555531866.226800 U4PLFM85R":{"client_msg_id":"99b876f8-e766-47e6-a424-b30e1928b691","type":"message","text":"Thanks <@U5KK1P1CN>! gave some of my thoughts below:\n\n&gt; I wonder if it isn’t the desire for superiority, but the _fear of inferiority_ that is at the root of such behavior?\n\nahh yeah, i think that’s a really interesting question, psychologically. could very well be a combination of both depending on the situation of the individual? i wonder if something like that matters at the evolutionary level or if it just matters there is a pressure for social status. at first glance, it seems it would matter as it involves different lower level parts\n\n&gt; What distorts this, perhaps, is a society where you _must_ be better than everyone in order to be worth talking about.\n\nafaik, this was totally the case historically before monogamy was more ubiquitous as a social norm. *preface*: i use “should” throughout this comment to mean “should in the interest of their genes” and is obviously not a representation of how people think, it’s how our genes want us to think. females have a fixed offspring output (10 months) while males can have a basically unlimited offspring output. males have basically no mandatory dedication post mating so they should not be very picky. females, on the other hand, have to dedicate a lot of time and resources to mating, so they should be very picky. any picky female should want to mate with the male they see as most fit in the population. this can lead to a skewed situation where some males have fathered many children and some have fathered none. i think this really fits the description that you’re proposing.\n\ninterestingly, this scenario causes lots of violence in the group of males that don’t have access to mating.  those males should use doomsday tactics in an attempt to mate, since their options are: keep doing the same thing and don’t mate or take the risk of violence in an attempt to either show superiority/kill competition and potentially get to mate. i’m pretty sure it’s been shown that monogamous societies in general have drastically less male on male violence.\n\n&gt; I do admit that in a hierarchical society of haves and have nots, it’s inevitable that the haves must justify their having (and thus make the have-nots feel worthless by comparison), so this thought experiment relies on the idea of a society without such a dynamic (which may or may not be possible at-scale?) but still, I could see this dynamic being the true cause of the superiority complex and not genetics/biology.\n\ni agree that i _could_ see society being the primary cause, but i could certainly also see evolution and underlying genetics being a primary cause too (i’m playing devil’s advocate, i don’t necessarily believe this is all there is to it). one explanation could be from how we “should” deal with genetic similarities. you share exactly 50% of your genes with a sibling but you share 100% of your genes with yourself (that seems weird to say but stay with me). you’re inclined to help your sibling because they share genes with you (helping them also helps half of your genes). so if something, say food, would benefit both of you the same, you should really only see it as benefiting them half as much because they only share 50% with you. given that, you should only give them the food if that food will benefit them at least twice as much as it will benefit you. so genes should want to code people to be incompatibly selfish potentially resulting in thinking more highly of oneself as more on the evolutionarily hardcoded side.\n\nalso if anyone is interested, my comments above draw a lot from Steven Pinker’s How the Mind Works, which is a really great read about the application of evolution to computational theory of mind.","user":"U4PLFM85R","ts":"1555531866.226800","edited":{"user":"U4PLFM85R","ts":"1555534022.000000"}},"1555630200.369700 U5KK1P1CN":{"client_msg_id":"d2e84aa1-1bc1-4d79-9b48-900b55f74495","type":"message","text":"Upon some further reading, it does seem though like the part of the argument that there are cultural differences in how exactly the \"sex -&gt;

In societies with the concept of partible paternity this often results in the nurture of a child being shared by multiple fathers in a form of polyandric relation to the mother, although this is not always the case.All cultures recognize different types of fatherhood - for example the distinction between biological fatherhood and legal fatherhood, and the corresponding social roles of genitor and pater. The concept of partible paternity however differs from such a distinction because it considers all men who have had sexual intercourse with a woman immediately prior to and during her pregnancy to have contributed biological material to the child, and to have a corresponding legal or moral responsibility to care for it. The concept of partible paternity has been described in at least 18 different societies, most of them located in the Amazon such as the Araweté, Mehinaku, Tapirapé, Xokleng, and Wari'. And for several others including the Ache and the Kulina.Anthropologist Stephen Beckerman, who has studied ideologies and practices of fatherhood among the Bari people of Venezuela, argues that partible paternity is adaptive, because it gives an advantage to children who have multiple male providers. He suggests a Bari child is 16% more likely than a single-fathered child to survive to the age of 15, probably due to improved nutrition. Among the Aché people of Eastern Paraguay, having multiple fathers appears to protect children from violence, the main cause of infant and child mortality.

While fascinating to think about, there is actually a lot of ambiguity there as to what is the “dominant” strategy (and it really tends to change over time anyway) and you can really make a case for many different approaches.\n\njust wanted to clarify that Pinker is not necessarily advocating for any particular strategy, it’s more abstract. and my comments may have confused that because i’ve been arguing implementations of his theory. his theory is (in my own words) that game theory determines the best strategies for individuals, those strategies that are rewarding over a long period of time will promote genes that code for traits that make individuals better at those strategies. in terms of the brain (under the model of computational theory of mind), this means the promotion of genes that code for brain parts that allow specific mental tools to be better. this type of theory can certainly include the strategies you provided, given they are best responses for either individuals or their genes at the time. <@U5KK1P1CN> i really think you would enjoy his book i mentioned earlier.","user":"U4PLFM85R","ts":"1555623509.361300"},"1555623501.361000 U4PLFM85R":{"client_msg_id":"ca6a17a4-9a36-4066-9b61-4f92e5afa80d","type":"message","text":"&gt; A little competitive infighting between males might be a worthwhile trade off in that case.\n\nthis is true from the female perspective, but historically in most societies males are the ones who determined social structure. so if men didn’t want the infighting (or there was an advantage to offspring if males contributed), males adopted social structures that allowed them to more reliably know which children they fathered.","user":"U4PLFM85R","ts":"1555623501.361000"},"1555623492.360700 U4PLFM85R":{"client_msg_id":"7238de18-c06e-457f-ae25-03262958acd8","type":"message","text":"&gt; women could still be relatively promiscuous, and you could say that would even be _advantageous_, because it becomes ambiguous which child “spawned from” which man, and thus the best strategy is to protect _all_ children.\n\nthe best strategies that are used by individuals for any given situation should be assessed with game theory. both game theory and observations in the field actually show the _opposite_ of this. when males can’t determine whether or not children are theirs, they actually contribute little to no resources. this is because it’s a viable strategy for another male to father children and never contribute any resources (keeping all of them for himself) so equilibrium occurs where no males give resources. by contributing resources to children that are not clearly yours, you have the potential to be taken advantage of by “wasting” resources on someone else’s genes. also from field research, females in polyandrous societies are mostly or fully responsible for child rearing.","user":"U4PLFM85R","ts":"1555623492.360700"}}
