Dash’s argument caught my eye. But then, a lot of Dash’s arguments catch my eye. He’s one of the most perceptive interpreters and critics of the tech industry around these days. That’s in part because Dash is part of the world he’s describing: He’s the CEO of Glitch, the host of the excellent tech podcast Function, and a longtime developer and blogger. In this conversation, Dash and I discuss his excellent list of the 12 things everyone should know about technology. This episode left me with an idea I didn’t have going in: What if the problem with a lot of the social technologies we use — and, lately, lament — isn’t the ethics of their creators or the revenue models they’re built on, but the sheer scale they’ve achieved? What if products like Facebook and Twitter and Google have just gotten too big and too powerful for anyone to truly understand, much less manage? You know the topics that obsess me on this podcast. Polarization. Identity. Attention. I’ve come to believe that all of them are downstream from the technologies on which they rest. If you feel like society has gone a bit wrong, it’s likely because the internet has gone a bit wrong. And Dash’s arguments help explain why.

All that money has to come from somewhere, and in a truly winner-take-all economy, the only place for it to come from is the profits of companies like Uber.\n\nI don't think that UBI is the tech elite's secret scheme to consolidate their power. The very nature of the technologies they are deploying do that. It is the inherent power of automation to displace human labor and the inevitable (given the current global market capitalist culture in charge) race to the bottom that will actualize that power. If anything, UBI is just the indulgence purchased to ease the Uber employees' conscience for their sins of disruption. Note the way it was brought up. \"Yes, we know we're doing all these terrible things. But what about UBI? Won't that make everything okay? Won't that save the lives we're otherwise destroying?\"\n\nThe takeaway is not to be against UBI. It's to remember that we mustn't give ourselves a moral pass and assume that someday there will be a political solution to clean up the mess we're creating now with our greed. Tech workers are starting to wake up to our power and what we can do to change the way our companies operate. Hopefully this will be enough.\n\nBut again, this doesn't mean forget about UBI. I think it is one of the most important policy ideas of our time. The time to implement it has not yet come, but it's on the horizon, and I think our most important task in the present is to try and prepare the political climate so that it can be implemented fairly and intelligently when the moment finally arrives and it becomes economically and socially viable.","user":"U0992K37U","ts":"1548141541.048700","thread_ts":"1548141541.048700","reply_count":19,"reply_users_count":4,"latest_reply":"1548218626.063500","reply_users":["U5KK1P1CN","U3GP0PYAF","U4PLFM85R","U0992K37U"],"replies":[{"user":"U5KK1P1CN","ts":"1548176096.055900"},{"user":"U5KK1P1CN","ts":"1548176209.057600"},{"user":"U3GP0PYAF","ts":"1548188392.058900"},{"user":"U4PLFM85R","ts":"1548190138.060000"},{"user":"U0992K37U","ts":"1548194713.060200"},{"user":"U4PLFM85R","ts":"1548198348.060500"},{"user":"U0992K37U","ts":"1548201930.060700"},{"user":"U0992K37U","ts":"1548202600.061000"},{"user":"U0992K37U","ts":"1548210588.061200"},{"user":"U0992K37U","ts":"1548210666.061400"},{"user":"U0992K37U","ts":"1548210966.061600"},{"user":"U0992K37U","ts":"1548211073.061900"},{"user":"U4PLFM85R","ts":"1548213141.062100"},{"user":"U4PLFM85R","ts":"1548213333.062300"},{"user":"U4PLFM85R","ts":"1548213722.062500"},{"user":"U0992K37U","ts":"1548216792.062900"},{"user":"U0992K37U","ts":"1548217165.063100"},{"user":"U0992K37U","ts":"1548218544.063300"},{"user":"U0992K37U","ts":"1548218626.063500"}],"subscribed":true,"last_read":"1548221129.000000"},"1548218626.063500 U0992K37U":{"client_msg_id":"8e604741-3799-4bda-80a3-f2ebb82ce658","type":"message","text":"Make no mistake, we actually all have a tremendous amount of social power, but it is mostly limited to small social groups and local communities.

We have wiped out diseases and transformed habitats, moved mountains, harnessed the power of electrons and atoms and delved the secrets of stars, as well as driven species to extinction and yes, critically altered the very air itself. All of this power is at our disposal. Even common individuals have a level of mastery over nature that the ancients could only have attributed to the gods.\n\nBut as soon as we face each other, the stakes change. We have a kind of democratic government that empowers the people, but by the time that power actually gets down to us, we get such a small sliver that we conclude our vote doesn't count. Even powerful executives and government officials feel trapped in systems of which they are only a small part. Meanwhile, the information age has made it so that only an insignificant minority of voices get amplified across the whole society, but even those voices are quickly forgotten amidst the continual stream of salient stimuli.\n\nWhat we ultimately want is social power. In the continual arms-race to achieve it, we have gained unprecedented power in the absolute sense, but paradoxically, this has decreased everyone's social power because a larger pie means more people, and more people means a smaller relative slice for each one.","user":"U0992K37U","ts":"1548218544.063300","thread_ts":"1548141541.048700","parent_user_id":"U0992K37U"},"1548217165.063100 U0992K37U":{"client_msg_id":"5a95e84c-6746-49b7-85a1-0f0b924703dd","type":"message","text":"It isn't wealth that's zero-sum, it's status, and it's social power.

This, I would argue, is the very core of greed.\n\nThe upside of this is that greed fuels economic growth. The downside is that greed fuels social collapse.
